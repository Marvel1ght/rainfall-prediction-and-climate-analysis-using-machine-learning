#  Rainfall Prediction and Climate Analysis Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on historical climate and weather data. The goal is to analyze climate patterns, extract meaningful insights, and develop a predictive system that can assist in weather-related decision-making.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
